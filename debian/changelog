 -- Troy Heber <troyh@debian.org>  Mon, 25 Jun 2012 09:42:10 -0600

dwarfutils (20120410-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 20120410.
  * libdwarf.h: A pointer "*" was right next to a "/*" so a space introduced
    between them for clarity. Fixed comments on DW_DLC_SIZE_64 and
    DW_DLC_SIZE_32.
  * dwarf_die_deliv.c: Two local variables were declared in the middle of
    code, accidentally creating C99 dependencies. Both trivially fixed with
    no change in logic.

dwarfutils (20111214-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release: 20111214.
  * dwarfdump[2]: Added support for DW_OP_GNU operators. Enhanced the
    extended-extensions table so known GNU tag-attr dependencies get no
    warning.  Added support for DWARF3/4 line table values. libdwarf: Added
    support for DW_OP_GNU operators. Added dwarf_lineoff_b() function making
    dwarf_lineoff() obsolete (but still present). Added
    dwarf_add_lineentry_b() as part of preparation for creating DWARF3/4 line
    output (including isa and discriminator fields). Added
    dwarf_prologue_end_etc() function to access line entry new fields. The
    consumer documentation is now at version 2.02 and producer doc at version
    1.32 . dwarfgen: Added example code generating line tables.
  * Now libdwarf and dwarfdump/dwarfdump2 support reading and printing the
    DWARF4 .debug_types section.
  * dwarfdump2: Major change! Now works just like dwarfdump -- with the same
    options and capabilities as dwarfdump but by taking advantage of C++
    features it is simpler to read and a bit faster than C dwarfdump.
    dwarfdump: Fixed some (minor) problems in detecting compilation units and
    showing errors. libdwarf: Now a bit more robust in detecting errors in
    object files
  * Some minor changes. libdwarf: added -fPIC to enable-shared builds, and
    implemented the ability to declare (in dwarfdump.conf) that address-size
    is 4 or 8. dwarfdump: Fixed tsearch related call with a memory leak, added
    a dwarfdump.conf example showing new includeabi: and address_size: command
    lines, configure now sets HAVE_STDAFX_H if that header (non-Linux) exists,
    verify checking is on before doing a duplicate-fde check. dwarfdump2:
    verify checking is on before doing a duplicate-fde check.

dwarfutils (20110612-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  - A function is in the producer: dwarf_producer_init_c(). This provides a
  user-defined void* pointer passed through from dwarf_producer_init_c() to
  the callback so the user code can provide whatever data it wishes to itself
  (in the callback). The library does not inspect the value in any way
  - Now DW_FORM_sdata/udata allowed for DW_AT_data_member_location
  - A very old bug (looking past the end of .debug_abbrev) fixed
  - Added a new function making it easier to get the 'class' of an attribute.
  Issues addressed, dwarfdump
  - Corrected some line-table error checking and made the options work more
  like they are described in a few cases
  - Added a new function making it easier to get the 'class' of an
  attribute.
  - dwarfdump had unused local variables and critical missing () in two tests
  made if statements incorrec
  - One place = was used in a test erroneously
  - The dwarfdump.1 man page is more informative about the -k options now
